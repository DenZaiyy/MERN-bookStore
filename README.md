# MERN APP
## Description
This is a MERN app created from freeCodeCamp's tutorial. It is a simple app that allows users to create, read, update, and delete exercises. It also allows users to create, read, update, and delete books. <br><br>The app uses MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

## MongoDB
To use mongoDB, you will need to copy the .env.example file and rename it to .env. Then, you will need to add your mongoDB URI to the .env file. <br><br>You can get a mongoDB URI by creating a free account on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

## Backend Dependencies & Running the server
To install backend dependencies from the root directory, run the following command:

```bash
cd backend && npm i
```

To run the server, run the following command (from the backend directory):

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Frontend Dependencies & Running the server

To install frontend dependencies from the root directory, run the following command:

```bash
cd frontend && npm i
```

To run the server, run the following command (from the frontend directory):

```bash

```

## Enjoy!
Now you can enjoy the app! You can create, read, update, and delete exercises and books. <br><br>Happy coding!
